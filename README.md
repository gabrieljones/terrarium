# terrarium
This is the starting concept for a Blinks application.
Right now it only has one object that can be placed in the world: drippers to create water.

Water will flow from tile to tile. Right now, gravity is restricted to fall from face 0 (top when reading the back sticker) to face 3 (bottom when reading the back sticker).

Eventually it'd be cool to have other things to add/do in the terrarium, but I'm already running out of space on the tile so I don't think I'll add much more.
